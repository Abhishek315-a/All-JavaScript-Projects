# All JavaScript Projects

A collection of simple, beginner-friendly JavaScript projects created during my learning journey. Each project focuses on core JavaScript concepts and is designed to be easy to understand and extend.

##  Projects Overview

Here's a quick look at what’s inside:

- **BMI Calculator**  
  A straightforward tool to compute Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height inputs.

- **Number Guess**  
  A fun interactive game where players guess a randomly generated number, receiving hints like "Too high!" or "Too low!" until they get it right.

- **Clock**  
  A live digital clock displaying the current time. (Consider adding a date display or stylish themes later!)

- **Color Change**  
  An app that changes a web page’s background color—either to a random shade or a user-specified one.
